[i-psdi.org](https://i-psdi.org) is a non-profit which builds tools for data analytics used by Fire Departments across the US. One of these is NFORS Exposure. I built new features and UIs in React Native as well as published releases, upgrades and assisted technical support staff in resolving bugs and any issues that arose with users as required.

In addition to developing the mobile application I was also responsible for leading the development and maintenance of the [web interface](https://app.nfors.org) built in Angular as well as the backend Node.js/Postgres application.

In order for Fire Fighters to be able to log their exposures we made use of [data aggregation and analytics platform](https://analytics.nfors.org/main) in order to warehouse those Incidents provided by their departments. To maintain quality of service we made use of Grafana and Cloudwatch to gain observability.
