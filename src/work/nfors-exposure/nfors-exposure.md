# Job Description: Software Developer at i-psdi.org

[i-psdi.org](https://i-psdi.org) is a non-profit organization that builds tools for data analytics used by fire departments across the US. As a software developer, I was responsible for:

- Building new features and UIs in React Native for NFORS Exposure, one of their data analytics tools.
- Publishing releases, upgrades, and assisting technical support staff in resolving bugs and issues that arose with users.
- Leading the development and maintenance of the web interface built in Angular as well as the backend Node.js/Postgres application.

To enable firefighters to log their exposures, we used a data aggregation and analytics platform to warehouse the incidents provided by their departments. To maintain quality of service, we made use of Grafana and Cloudwatch to gain observability.

## Tech Stack:

- AWS / Kubernetes
- Node.js/Postgres API
- Grafana / Cloudwatch
- Angular frontend
- Github Actions
- Bitrise CI/CD
- Sentry (error logging)
- Mobile app (React Native / iOS / Android)
- NFORS Analytics (Elasticsearch)

Note: The tech stack is inclusive of the technologies used in the development of i-psdi.org's tools and may not be a comprehensive list of all the technologies used.
