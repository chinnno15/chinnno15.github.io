# Job Description: Lead Software Developer at i-psdi.org

At [i-psdi.org](https://i-psdi.org) , I leveraged my full-stack development and data engineering expertise to lead small teams in building and maintaining projects for NIST, FEMA, NIOSH, and others. In addition to developing the much-needed DevOps skill set.
Enterprise Application Development: Led the creation of a high-performance React-Native application serving tens of thousands of users. Collaborated with data scientists, DevOps, and SRE engineers to ensure the application met high standards of performance and reliability.
**API Development & Management**: Developed and maintained APIs using Node.js and PostGIS, including APIs specifically for the React-Native application. Provided crucial data on drive times and fire risks.
**Data Management & Analytics**: Implemented big data technologies for managing, ingesting, and analyzing large datasets, including data for tens of millions of 911 calls across the US and Canada. Built a custom data warehousing solution using S3, Trino, and Elasticsearch to power dashboards for statengine.io.
**Workflow Automation**: Created CLI tools to streamline data processing workflows, enhancing team productivity.
**Scalable Infrastructure**: Designed and maintained a robust scalable infrastructure utilizing a wide range of technologies, including:
**AWS Services**: Implemented solutions using EC2 for scalable computing, RDS and Postgres for reliable relational database management, Redis for fast in-memory data storage, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and SQS for message queuing.
**Containerization & Orchestration**: Utilized Kubernetes for container orchestration, ensuring efficient deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
**CI/CD Pipeline**: Employed Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, automating the build, test, and deployment processes to streamline development workflows.

## Results

These contributions were critical during the 2020 COVID pandemic, when we built and scaled these systems to handle a massive spike in Health Emergency calls. The scalable backend services improved system reliability and performance, while the data management and analytics capabilities provided valuable insights supporting critical decision-making. Serving 27,000 fire departments and handling extensive 911 call data enhanced emergency response and operational effectiveness across the US and Canada. The custom data warehousing solution for statengine.io improved dashboard capabilities, offering comprehensive and actionable insights to users and enhancing data accessibility.
